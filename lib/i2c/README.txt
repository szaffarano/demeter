These are the original file descriptions, this README needs to be cleaned
up to reflect the new changes in this library.

 @brief I2C (TWI) Master Software Library

 Basic routines for communicating with I2C slave devices. This single master 
 implementation is limited to one bus master on the I2C bus. 

 This I2c library is implemented as a compact assembler software implementation of the I2C protocol 
 which runs on any AVR (i2cmaster.S) and as a TWI hardware interface for all AVR with built-in TWI hardware (twimaster.c).
 Since the API for these two implementations is exactly the same, an application can be linked either against the
 software I2C implementation or the hardware I2C implementation.

 Use 4.7k pull-up resistor on the SDA and SCL pin.
 
 Adapt the SCL and SDA port and pin definitions and eventually the delay routine in the module 
 i2cmaster.S to your target when using the software I2C implementation ! 
 
 Adjust the  CPU clock frequence F_CPU in twimaster.c or in the Makfile when using the TWI hardware implementaion.

 @note 
    The module i2cmaster.S is based on the Atmel Application Note AVR300, corrected and adapted 
    to GNU assembler and AVR-GCC C call interface.
    Replaced the incorrect quarter period delays found in AVR300 with 
    half period delays.

 @par API Usage Example
  The following code shows typical usage of this library, see example test_i2cmaster.c

 @code

 #include <i2cmaster.h>


 #define Dev24C02  0xA2      // device address of EEPROM 24C02, see datasheet

 int main(void)
 {
     uint8_t ret;

     i2c_init();                             // initialize I2C library

     // write 0x75 to EEPROM address 5 (Byte Write) 
     i2c_start_wait(Dev24C02+I2C_WRITE);     // set device address and write mode
     i2c_write(0x05);                        // write address = 5
     i2c_write(0x75);                        // write value 0x75 to EEPROM
     i2c_stop();                             // set stop conditon = release bus


     // read previously written value back from EEPROM address 5 
     i2c_start_wait(Dev24C02+I2C_WRITE);     // set device address and write mode

     i2c_write(0x05);                        // write address = 5
     i2c_rep_start(Dev24C02+I2C_READ);       // set device address and read mode

     ret = i2c_read_nak();                   // read one byte from EEPROM
     i2c_stop();

     for(;;);
